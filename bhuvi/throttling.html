Throttling in JavaScript
Throttling is another optimization technique like debouncing, but instead of delaying a function until a specific amount of time has passed without any new call, throttling ensures that a function is called at most once every specified interval. Throttling is useful when you want to ensure that a function is executed regularly but not too frequently, even if it's triggered multiple times in a row.

Use Cases for Throttling:
Scroll event handling: Executing a function every time a user scrolls can cause performance issues. Throttling allows the function to be called at regular intervals, e.g., once every 200ms.
Resizing windows: Similarly, resizing can trigger many events in a short time.
Button clicks: Prevent users from clicking a button too rapidly.
Key Concept:
Throttled function: Ensures that a function is only called once within a specific interval, no matter how many times it's triggered.

Throttling Properties:
Interval: The minimum amount of time that must pass between consecutive calls to the throttled function. This is controlled by the interval parameter.
Last Time: The time at which the function was last executed is tracked internally to compare it with the current time.

Throttling is a technique used to limit how frequently a function can be executed, even if it is triggered multiple times.
throttling ensures that the function is executed at regular intervals, no matter how frequently it's called.

Key Differences Between Throttling and Debouncing:
Debouncing: Ensures that a function is called only after a specified time has passed since the last call.
Useful for cases like search input where you want to delay the function execution until the user has finished typing.
Throttling: Ensures that a function is called at most once every specified interval, even if it's triggered repeatedly during that time.
Useful for cases like scrolling or resizing, where the function needs to execute regularly but not too frequently.
