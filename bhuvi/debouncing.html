<!--
Debouncing is a programming technique used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often. It is most commonly used in event handling to prevent an event from being triggered too many times in a short period. When a function is debounced, it will only be executed once after a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was invoked.

Use Cases for Debouncing:
Search input: Prevent sending requests on every keystroke.
Window resizing: Avoid continuous resize events during the resize process.
Scrolling: Avoid triggering scroll-based animations or data loading multiple times.

Key Concept:
Debounced function: A debounced function will delay its execution until after a certain amount of time has passed without it being called again. This helps optimize performance by limiting how frequently a function is invoked.

Methods and Properties:
Debouncing is a technique, not an object, so it doesnâ€™t have its own methods and properties. Instead, it wraps a function with a mechanism that controls when it can be invoked.
Debouncing Mechanism (Basic Structure):
Function wrapping: The original function is wrapped inside a debouncing function.
Timeout: The debouncing function waits for a certain amount of time (e.g., 300ms) before invoking the actual function.
Reset on repeated calls: If the debounced function is called again before the waiting period ends, the timer resets.

Debouncing Properties:
While debouncing itself doesn't have formal "properties," its behavior is affected by several factors:

Delay: The number of milliseconds to wait before executing the function (300ms in the example above).
Immediate Execution (optional): You can configure debounced functions to run immediately on the first call, then delay subsequent calls.

Real-World Use Cases for Debouncing:
Search input fields: Only send the search query after the user has stopped typing.
Window resizing: Recalculate layout or perform other resource-heavy tasks only after the user has finished resizing the window.
Form validation: Validate form fields only after the user has stopped interacting with them.
Scrolling events: Avoid triggering scroll event handlers too frequently while scrolling.

      // Simulate an API request with a delay (this is just for demonstration)
    }

    // Get reference to input field
    const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');

    // Create a debounced version of the search function with a 300ms delay
    const handleSearchInput = debounce(function(event) {
      const query = event.target.value;
      search(query);  // Call the debounced search function
    }, 300);

    // Add event listener to the input field to listen for 'input' event
    searchInput.addEventListener('input', handleSearchInput);
